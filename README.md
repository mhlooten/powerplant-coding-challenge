## Build and launch the API
To run the backend, navigate inside the main folder.  
Install the requirements in requirements.txt and execute `python main.py`.    
The backend should now be available locally on port 8888.  
Payloads can be POSTed on the */productionplan* endpoint (http://localhost:8888/productionplan).
